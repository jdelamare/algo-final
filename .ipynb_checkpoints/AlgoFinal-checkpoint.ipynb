    "# Analysis of TSP Approximation Algorithms\n",
    "## Introduction to TSP\n",
    "The problem is often described as a salesman who would like to visit each city no more than once and return home. The journey to each city has a certain expense; the salesman would like to find the most optimal solution. This can be represented with edge weights between the vertices. So we want to find a route where the sum of the edge weights is the lowest possible value. Given a large set of cities (nodes) this has proven to be an intractable problem- it's NP-hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into it, let's consider two other common paths that may traverse a graph. The first is an Eulerian circuit which touches every node in the graph and returns to the origin. The second is a Hamiltonian cycle which similar to the Eulerian cycle in that it must touch every node and return to the origin. However the Hamiltonian cycle mandates that each node is only visited once. This is quite similar to the Traveling Salesperson Problem, a reduction can be shown to prove that TSP is NP-hard without too much massaging. Think of the Traveling Salesman Problem as finding the Hamiltonian cycle with the minimum possible weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the algorithms in question, and indeed the ones implemented below, are only approximations. Approximations appear to be the only way to solve inputs that are millions of cities large. They find solutions with approximation ratios that may be considered \"good enough\". Good enough of course depends on the standard one chooses to hold, but algorithms of note seem to yield a solution which is 2-3% close to optimal.[1] One of the approximations will fail terribly, this is the nearest neighbor. Christofides actually does quite well, yielding the best approximation ratio of all known algorithms in the general case. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why I chose this algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph theory primer\n",
    "This is a graph problem, being as such there are a few properties we can exploit, and some that will hinder us. We already talked about the Hamiltonian Cycle and its relationship with the Traveling Salesperson Problem, but we didn't consider the graph itself. There are two types of graphs of note. One is a complete graph and the other is not. A complete graph means that all edges in the graph can reach every other edge. Any two nodes in a graph that are not connected makes a graph incomplete, but it may still be connected. A connected graph means that, by some path, we can reach every node. This is usually verified by running DFS on the graph, an operation that has a smaller time complexity than the algorithm for finding a TSP solution. In fact, the input graph is verified at the beginning to confirm it's connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the graph's nodes (vertices). For this problem we'll need to keep an associated attribute with the node to determine if it has already been visited. Remember, we're not allowed to visit the same city twice. We'll also want to note the origin, or the location that we've started at because the result should be a cycle. This means that our salesperson returns to the place from which they began. Nodes are pretty straight forward, as long as they're connected by edges we should be alright.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the edges, which have slightly more interesting properties. This is an undirected graph, which generally makes traversal more simple. This means that an edge can be taken in either direction. Edges also have a second property, which is their weight. The weight of an edge is an attribute that states how costly it will be for our salesperson to travel from the current node along that edge to the next node. The graphs used here are not plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system. This means that the distance between a pair of nodes has nothing to do with the weight of the edge. As an aside, the graphs plotted below have nodes placed in a screw formation to make them readable. Graphviz, another plotting tool, makes graphs where the nodes do not overlap and the edges can be traced. Back to these edges; another constraint on the weights are that they cannot be negative. This is useful for the functions, and makes sense in reality. A salesperson cannot go a negative distance, as it really has no meaning. Finally, let's acknowledge the variation in weights. I've set the upper bound to be about twice as much as the number of nodes. However, there may still be two edges with the same value incident to a node. Which edges will be taken depends on the alogrithm in question, but it should make no difference in analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To elaborate slightly more on the cycles that are discovered, first remember that we're looking for a best approximation. While it may make sense to try an algorithm more than once from various origins, it seems fitting that we'll just accept the bad answer that we're provided on the first completion. This saves us from the rabbit hole of searching for an optimal solution using an algorithm that we know may not provide one. So once a valid Hamiltonian cycle is found, we consider that the result of the algorithm. With a completed graph this should always execute on the first try. However, if the graph is not complete we may exhaust other origins in an attempt to find the cycle. Importantly, an algorithm may not find a path for our salesperson even though one exists if the input graph is not connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it must be explicitly addressed that we're looking for an approximation algorithm. These are not guaranteed to yield an optimal solution, in fact they likely won't. There is need for a metric to compare these algorithms and the optimal solution is the clear choice. For large inputs a known optimal solution can be pitted against the algorithms developed here. The way to measure how well one algorithm did in comparison to the optimal path is to take the ratio of the two. This is known as the approximation ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Nearest neighbor\n",
    "This algorithm is a great example of what not to do. For one, it very easily will not find a solution even when one is evident. Nearest neighbor is a greedy algorithm which means it will take whatever choice looks best from its current position. When it arrives at a node it evaluates each of the neighboring nodes and determines which have yet to be accessed. Then it takes the lowest weight of those possibilities. It's horribly simple, but will always find a solution on a completed graph. The approximation ratio from various sources state that it gets to within 15-25% of the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that this is a silly procedure as it could funnel its way into a trap from which it cannot return. This tends to happen most with triangle shapes where the point furthest from the origin has the heaviest edge of the three that comprise the triangle. This is because it will navigate the base of the triangle, then greedily turn away from the origin and towards the point of the triangle. From here it cannot return as it's already touched the two base nodes. Surely there are other mistakes that this algorithm can make, but this one happens to be easiest to imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a map, this may be the way someone would travel in reality. If you think about it, we're just taking the path of least resistance. If what's immediately in front of us proves to be a challenge (high weight), we'll look for all other routes before taking it. Clearly this is suboptimal as there are many cases in life where the challenging path up front results in a better overall result. Another issue with this algorithm is we may end up taking simple paths all the way till the end, but be forced to take an expensive path to the origin. Obviously this happens because we've removed all other nodes from the set of optional moves, but without a mechanism that provides foresight it's an unavoidable expense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some annotated [mathy stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM5MW5NKZJg)\n",
    "```\n",
    "1) The distance between any two nodes is greater than or equal to zero \n",
    "     d(x,y) >= 0\n",
    "2) The graph is undirected \n",
    "     d(x,y) = d(y,x) \n",
    "3) The triangle inequality exists: If a single edge reachs a point that two or more edges can reach together, the single edge is shorter than the sum of the other edges. \n",
    "     d(x,y) + d(y,z) >= d(x,z)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Psuedocode\n",
    "Just to be clear, the structure of the psuedocode came from Wikipedia and has been elaborated on. In general, it's standard to consider node `u` as the node we're currently at and node `v` as the node to which we may travel. This is evident based on parameters in the `networkx` python3 library used below. Also, the original psuedocode must have been written for a complete graph. The modifications made will rotate the origin through all possible nodes until a Hamiltonian cycle is found. Again, we have no way of guaranteeing a better path, so we halt on the first encountered.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Psuedocode\n",
    " 0) sum = the total cost of traveling the paths.\n",
    " 1) Initialize all vertices as unvisited and add them the list possible origins.\n",
    " 2) Select a vertex from the list of possible origins, set it as the current vertex u. Mark u as visited.\n",
    " 3) Find out the shortest edge e connecting the current vertex u and an unvisited vertex v.\n",
    " 4) Set v as the current vertex u. Mark v as visited. Add e to sum.\n",
    " 5) If u can access another vertex v that is not the origin go to step 3.\n",
    " 6) Else If u can access the origin via e add e to sum and return sum\n",
    " 6) Else remove the origin from the list of possible origins.  \n",
    " 7)   If possible origins is empty return false, no path found.\n",
    " 8)   Else go to step 2.\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "Of course, when analyzing an algorithm we only care about worst case complexity (big O). Here, the worst case possibility is we find our path when the last possible origin is used from the list of possible origins. This means that we have looked at each node once for every possible origin. Since all nodes are candidates for an origin, we have a `O(n^2)` algorithm. Let's put this into perspective to see how bad it is. Depth first search, an algorithm which also traverses all of the nodes in a graph, has a runtime of `O(|V|+|E|)`. You could say that it's a linear algorithm with space complexity greater than constant because it keeps track of the route taken. Well considering it's not tasked with finding a Hamiltonian circuit, nearest neighbor doesn't actually seem that bad! It's polynomial after all, and it's space complexity is just a list of all the nodes in the graph, `O(n)`. A very tolerable running time indeed. But we must not forget its numerous pitfalls. For one, it may not find a solution even though it exists. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that I did not implement reptitive nearest neighbor. Reptitive nearest neighbor would run the algorithm above on all inputs and store every possible route until the origin list has been exhausted. From there it would compare the different solutions and find the shortest of the paths in that data structure. In my opinion, this blows up the space complexity and would not be practical. In theory, this would have been easy to accomplish by storing the path with all of the path data in a lookup table. Now our space complexity would be `O(n^2)` since there may be a copy of all paths for each possible origin. The runtime complexity would still be `O(n^2)`. Even though it's often considered that storage is cheap, for a large graph the first Hamiltonian cycle may also prove to be a challenge. Since the results are already expected to be suboptimal, with a particular input repetitive nearest neighbor would not be necessary. Briefly, there are some interesting guarantees when iterating through every possible origin. For instance, it will always produce a tour better than at least `n/2-1`. other possible tours. Sometimes it finds a tour better than `n-2` other tours when `n >= 4`. (TODO CITE)\n",

    "Briefly, I want to mention the small graph. It doesn't lend any use to comparing the algorithm against an optimal solution, but it does develop a human intution. We're quite capable of seeing a decent cycle, and we can also follow a graph by hand to find where one route underperforms and another would succeed. This is because we have a top down picture and foresight, the greedy algorithm does not. That being said, for small examples nearest neighbor works quite well. The algorithm often found the same path that I would find through the graph. If it did not find a path, it was probably stuck in a subgraph it could not escape. Of course there are better approximation algorithms like Christofides, but it does perform better than I had anticipated.\n",

    "tried to use the .tsp format but it was not helpful as I'd need to make a complete graph out of a large set of points. This is n choose 2 for an undirected graph. I also tried to make data by processing longitude and latitude data, which may have been feasible. Unfortunately all decent TSP sets seem to use the euclidean distance format expect for the World Traveling problem. This text file has 190,4710 different coordinates. Processing these also would have been a challenge, and I still would have to make all of the connections. Big mistake, should have used distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I assumed that many more libraries would have the functionality to solve TSP. In fact, I thought that networkx had that ability. Turns out, it's D-Wave's overlay ontop of networkx that has contains a TSP solver. The only downside is it takes a monstrous amount of memory. Here's the error from using 7 nodes in the graph:\n",

    "What would I have done differently? Well, I would have programmed against the project described in the Georgia Tech document, because there is quite a bit of information on the TSP beyond the algorithms alone. For instance, there is a data format which I just now found out about. Would have been nice to look into this ahead of time.\n",
